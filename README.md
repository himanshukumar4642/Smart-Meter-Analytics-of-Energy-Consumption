# Smart-Meter-Analytics-of-Energy-Consumption


Using Energy in an efficient way can help to satisfy production of energy to meet growth in demand which in turn would help reduce CO2 emissions. 
In order to achieve this goal we need to understand and improve the energy efficiency at both producer and consumer ends in an AMI system. 
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enabled smart energy grids like smart meters and devices are being set up globally to measure energy consumption and improve energy efficiency, especially in metropolitan areas.
These smart meter produce huge volumes of data which is in different formats. 
This data needs to be collected, stored and analyzed  for the purpose of knowledge discovery and supporting energy efficiency. 
This analysis need to be presented in an interactive visualization and the extracted insights can be used further for deriving “information” which will help in effective understanding. 
But the challenge is to analyze this data in real time scale because of which ,then with the time, 
volume and veracity of data both and also scope of analysis is expected to increase their level. So a proper and efficient machine learning model needs to build and work upon.
